My Ubuntu boilerplate image that forms the base for my docker containers. Starts a SSH server by default

This is a ubuntu-baseimage-supervisored that supprts start:app as init command that tails supervisord log and has a sshd in i like the image as starting point it is more clean then the phusion one
